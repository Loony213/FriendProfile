# Name Service Overview ðŸ”§

The **services** folder contains the core logic of the application. The `name_service.py` file specifically handles the business logic for retrieving a user's friend name based on their email address. It connects to the database and performs the necessary queries to fetch the friend's name.

## Purpose ðŸŽ¯
The **name_service.py** file contains the function `fetch_name`, which is responsible for querying the database and retrieving the name of the user associated with the given email. It interacts directly with the database to ensure that the correct data is returned to the caller (controller or route).

## Functionality ðŸ”§
- **Database Connection**: The service uses a utility function `get_db_connection` from the `db` module to establish a connection with the database.
- **Query Execution**: It runs a SQL query to retrieve the name of the user associated with the provided email.
- **Data Fetching**: The service retrieves the email from the database and returns it to the caller. If no matching user is found, it returns `None`.

This service ensures that the core business logic of fetching a friend's name is abstracted and handled in a dedicated layer, promoting separation of concerns.

## Features âœ¨
- **Database Interaction**: The service interacts with the database to fetch specific details (i.e., the user's name) using SQL queries.
- **Data Abstraction**: It abstracts the complexity of database interaction from the controllers and routes, simplifying the application logic.
- **Error Handling**: If no user is found with the given email, it gracefully returns `None`, ensuring that the application doesn't crash.

The **name_service.py** file is essential for handling the logic of querying the database to retrieve the user's name, ensuring the correct data is returned to the user in the **FriendProfile** system.
