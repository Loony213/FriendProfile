# Description Service Overview ðŸ”§

The **services** folder contains the core business logic of the application. The `description_service.py` file specifically handles the logic for retrieving a user's friend profile description from the database. It abstracts the interaction with the database and ensures that the necessary data is fetched based on the user's email.

## Purpose ðŸŽ¯
The **description_service.py** file contains the function `fetch_description`, which queries the database to retrieve the description of a user's friend profile based on their email. It interacts with the database to retrieve and return the friend's description.

## Functionality ðŸ”§
- **Database Connection**: The service utilizes a utility function `get_db_connection` from the **utils/db.py** file to establish a connection to the database.
- **Query Execution**: It executes an SQL query to retrieve the description of a user associated with the given email address.
- **Data Fetching**: The service returns the description of the user, or `None` if no description is found.

This service ensures that the core logic for fetching a friend's description is handled in a dedicated service layer, abstracting database interactions and separating business logic from the controller layer.

## Features âœ¨
- **Database Interaction**: The service interacts with the database to fetch the user's profile description using SQL queries.
- **Error Handling**: If no description is found for the given email, the service gracefully returns `None`, preventing the application from crashing.
- **Reusability**: The service can be reused in multiple parts of the application to retrieve a user's profile description, promoting code reuse and maintainability.

The **description_service.py** file is essential for handling the business logic of querying the database to fetch the description of a user's friend, ensuring the correct data is returned in the **FriendProfile** system.
