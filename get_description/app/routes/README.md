# Description Routes Overview üåê

The **routes** folder contains the routing logic for the application. The `description_routes.py` file specifically handles the routing related to retrieving a user's friend profile description. It acts as the point of entry for the request and directs the flow to the appropriate controller for processing.

## Purpose üéØ
The **description_routes.py** file defines the routes of the microservice. It sets up the URL endpoint `/get-description` and associates it with the **description_controller** function, which handles the logic for retrieving a friend's description.

The routes are crucial for setting up the web service and ensuring that incoming HTTP requests are directed to the appropriate functionality for processing.

## Functionality üîß
- **Blueprint Definition**: The routes are encapsulated within a Flask `Blueprint`. This allows the routes to be modular and reusable across different parts of the application.
- **Request Handling**: It listens for GET requests at the `/get-description` endpoint, directing these requests to the `get_description` controller.
- **Integration with Controller**: The controller (`description_controller.py`) is responsible for the logic that fetches the friend's description.

This routing mechanism ensures that all requests for retrieving a friend's description are properly directed and processed, maintaining a clean separation between routing, controllers, and services.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Modular Routing**: The routes are managed in a Flask `Blueprint`, making it easy to add or remove routes without affecting other parts of the application.
- **Integration with Controllers**: Directly connects the route to the controller function (`get_description`), ensuring that the correct logic is executed for each request.
- **Simple Route Management**: Handles the GET request for the `/get-description` endpoint and integrates seamlessly with the rest of the application.

The **description_routes.py** file is an essential part of the application, ensuring that HTTP requests are correctly routed to the appropriate controller for processing in the **FriendProfile** domain.
